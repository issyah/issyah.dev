Finally I got it completed (Sort of). This is a cool visualisation tool that consolidates all diploma courses available at our 5 local Singapore polytechnics.

During my final year project, I had a nightmare trying to make the visualisation work with the project requirements. That is why I love it. D3.js is a powerful javascript library that enables you to create really amazing visualisation. Bar chart? Err no. Yawns. Line Chart? Nope. Collapsible Tree Diagram? YES.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/d3.jpg" alt="alt text" title="D3.js D3.js"></p>\n<p>There are many visualisation tools available for D3.js but for this project purposes, I went ahead and used the collapsible Tree Diagram. Well, you might think, it is easier to just display the entire course list in a table and scroll through the data. However, you wouldnâ€™t be able to see the different clusters of courses available within a school. And obviously, it looks way cooler and amazing. You can take a look at an example <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7880033">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/d3-tree.jpg" alt="alt text" title="D3 Collapsible Tree D3 Collapsible Tree"></p>\n<p><a href="https://sg.polycourses.com">Polycourses</a> is built with Nuxt.js, Taildwind.css, D3.js and lodash.

The course code is used to pull more descriptive information from data.gov.sg.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of different datasets, some description may not be available. Some data are outdated as well. I may include other statistical data like total intake/graduates etc in the near future. But in the meantime, have a go!</p>\n<h2><a href="https://sg.polycourses.com">Polycourses</a></h2>\n<p><img src="/images/polycourses-app.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Polycourses Polycourses App"></p>\n'}}}]);
